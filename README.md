## Suggesting Events

If your meetup allows other organizers or members to suggest events, letâ€™s hear about it!

- [Node.DC](https://www.meetup.com/node-dc/) accepts talk and event suggestions at [NodeDC/talks](https://github.com/NodeDC/talks).
- [DCJS](https://www.meetup.com/DC-JavaScript/) accepts talk and event suggestions at [DCJS/talks](https://github.com/dcjs/talks)

## Sub-Organizing Groups

If your meetup organizes itself publicly anywhere, add it to the list!

- [Node.DC](https://www.meetup.com/node-dc/) does some of its organizing at [NodeDC/organizers](https://github.com/NodeDC/organizers).
- [DCJS](https://www.meetup.com/DC-JavaScript/) does some planning and organization at [DCJS/organizing](https://github.com/dcjs/organizing).
