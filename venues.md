# Venues

This is not an exhaustive list, but these are places that have hosted meetups in the past and any peculiarities of those locations. Meetups that have used the location are included so that you can reach out to them (**contact info should NOT be included** for privacy reasons).

Also, please try not to subjectively rate a venue. This is a place for **facts** about venues, let other meetup organizing teams evaluate a venue for themselves. This is _not_ a place to vent about a bad venue.
